Scheduler

Just enter a few courses and hit submit. Our program will generate and display all of the possible schedules for those courses. The sorting options control which schedules are displayed first, allowing you to find the one that suits your needs.


To run, type %run gui.py in ipython.

Packages needed: ldap3 (ldap for python3), jsonpickle, and tkinter.

WARNING: Update courses takes a few minutes. You won't need to update to see how our program works.
